Initial roll is from 2011. 
Need  tests

NOTE: mx-1.2.12 patched version was installed on FE and vm-containers to prevent log 
files /var/run/fms//fma.log build up (fill disk within a week)
make roll and install on vm containers and frontend.
The log size problem effects only vm-container nodes and frontend, the compute nodes are unaffected.
Bug report was filed with myrinet developmers.
